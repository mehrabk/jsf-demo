JSF facelets templating:
    Templating is the ability to reuse portion of your layout in order to follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.
    This allows you to easily structure your web page into multiple reusable components.
    Templating also helps in maintaining a standard look and feel in an application with a large number of pages.
    JavaServer faces technology provides the tools to implement user interfaces that are easy to extend and reuse.

ELResolver:
    - We can extend the ELResolver class to create our own implicit variables in JSF
    1- Create a class that extends from the ELResolver.
    2- Implement the required abstract methods.
    3- Register your custom El resolver with the faces-config.xml.

    - By extending the ElResolver class you need to implement 6 methods:
        - getValue: this method returns a value if the base is null and the property requested is named beers.
        - getType: this method identifies the type for our property. Determines wheter the call of the setValue method is safe without causing a ClassCastException to be thrown.
        - setValue: this method tries to set the value for a given property and base. If the variable is readonly you’ll need to throw a PropertyNotWritableException.
        - isReadOnly: determines wheter a variable is readonly.
        - getFeatureDescriptors: this method is used by a design time tool. It returns a set of information about the variables or properties that can be resolved.
        - getCommonPropertyType: returns the most general type that this resolver accepts.

JSF Bookmarkable View Parameters:
    - These are implemented by the UIViewParameter class that extends UIInput.
    - View parameters can be included in links by using the includeVidwParams=”true”.
    - JSF gets the request parameter’s values by name from the page URL and applies optional specified converters/validators. After conversion/validation succeeds and before the view is rendered, JSF binds the values of the request parameters to the managed bean properties by calling the appropriate setter methods.
